###Git Repository  

My Git repository is very simple, I’ve cloned my angular project directly into the repository in the same format it was created in. I have stored my Angular folder separate from my Server side files files and the two are linked together with help from cors. My Server side holds my server.js file along with all of my routes.
I’ve been using my Github as a basic storage location. I did have a few minor problems, when I first created my assignment it was located inside my 3813ICT coursework folder along with all of my weekly workshops. I needed to copy the file and create a dedicated Git Repository for it so I lost all of the commits I did before that. 
My approach to version control was simple, I committed after every few routes I created. Furthermore, I did need to create a test branch when I decided to test out changes to my data structure and did not want to ruin my entire assignment. This test was successful so I merged the branch back into my master.
